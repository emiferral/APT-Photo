<H2>APT Photo and Video </H2>got it's start back in 2015 as a small photography business, eventually beginning to grow as a team and starting to expand services into other fields such as videography, aerial photography & videography, and even services such as photo booths for guests to use the day of your event.  <br>
Initially we began as just a photography business but have since expanded into videography, aerial photography and videography and other services during events. Over the years we've taken on plenty of jobs ranging from weddings and family photos to Quinceañeras or baptisms, no matter the event you're planning we're more than ready to capture those precious moments for you! In addition to working on large scale events we also offer services for smaller things such as Family Photos or Portraits. <br>
At APT we offer three different product packages for you to choose from which may include your choice of photos printed, an edited movie of your event, a photo booth to be set up the day of your event for guests and yourself to use, drone footage and much more! Despite being based in Indianapolis we're more than happy to go to you for your event, previously having gone as far as Evansville or Chicago! We hope you think of us when looking into booking a photography service!
